This is the git project for homework assignments in [CIS 501: Fall 2015](http://cis.upenn.edu/~cis501/).

This code is written in Java and setup as an ant project. To get started:

# clone the repo
# from the root directory of the repo, run `ant test`. This will
build the code and run one simple test case.
